Along with fractals, chaos theory is one of the essential, universal influences on patterns in nature. In essence, the theory shows how systems of chaotic, apparent randomness have an underlying pattern, or repetition.</p><p>The work of sculptor Matt Devine echoes the natural world, as the artist creates wonderfully complex works that resonate with both chaos and order. Perhaps this is why we can’t stop looking at Devine’s <em>Brass Tax</em>. Elevated by the use of a metallic finish, the piece is a minimalist refinement of nature, form and sequence.</p>",

      "<p>Long before chaos theory, scientists have hypothesized on the apparent beauty of the “irregular” in nature. In the 1841 edition of the American Repertory of Arts, Sciences and Manufactures (Volume 3), James Jay Mapes pens a deftly, eloquently written ode to the irregularities of our world, the stars, the oceans, the mountains and deserts. Mapes describes how our perceptions of beauty are built upon such irregularities - poignant breaks from any visible pattern, that are then captured and described in works of art. &nbsp;</p><p>“…the relative distances of the planets, their magnitudes, and the number of their satellites, conform to no known numerical law. The fixed stars exhibit no regular arrangement, either in their magnitudes, distances, or positions, but appear scattered at random across the sky. To descend to our own earth, no symmetry is traceable in the forms of island or continents, the courses of rivers, or the directions of mountain chains… In the “human face divine,” portrait painters affirm that the two sides never correspond; and even when the external form of an animal exhibits an appearance of bilateral or radiate symmetry, nature departs from it in her arrangement of the internal structure. In short, variety is a great and a most beautiful law of nature: it is that which distinguishes her productions from those of art, and it is that which man often exerts his highest efforts…to imitate.”</p><p>In a recent text, <em>Aesthetics of Ugliness: A Critical Edition</em> by Karl Rosenkranz, the author stipulates, that although “free multiplicity” is indeed beautiful, “regularity tires through its stereotypical sameness, which presents to us difference always in the same manner, so that we long to get out of its uniformity and into freedom, even if <em>in extremis</em> it is a chaotic freedom.”</p>",

It was heading to Materials for the Arts (MFTA), an arm of New York City\u2019s Department of Cultural Affairs that keeps discarded materials from entering landfills, and instead makes them available to creative organizations and public schools around the city, for free. <\/p><p>Several months after the sand landed at MFTA\u2019s headquarters, in Long Island City, Queens, it was reincarnated in an NYC classroom, as the foundation for a new community garden. <\/p><p>\u201cThat sand had a very rich life,\u201d Kwame Belle, MFTA\u2019s communications coordinator, tells me as we walk through the organization\u2019s 35,000-square-foot warehouse, which hosts materials ranging from sand to slop sinks, from cans of paint to spools of Pantone fabric. \u201cIt went from Anne Hathaway rolling around in it onstage, to a bunch of third graders pouring it out into their community garden,\u201d Belle continues. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of full-circle moment we\u2019re trying to create here: culture reused as more culture.\u201d<\/p>"

In an era before Craigslist, she took the zoo\u2019s request to a local radio show. Minutes after her appeal was broadcasted, calls offering working refrigerators flooded the phone line in her office\u2014and she realized this model could be applied and adapted to support other organizations, too. <\/p><p>MFTA was born soon after, as a nonprofit with a mission to provide free materials to creative non-profits in New York City, and bolster the city\u2019s recycling efforts in the process. Funded primarily by the NYC Department of Cultural Affairs, with support from the New York Department of Sanitation, the organization began by canvassing businesses and individuals across the five boroughs for discarded materials. These spoils were collected from donors, then housed and organized in MFTA\u2019s first headquarters at Chelsea Market on the West Side of Manhattan. There, arts professionals and artists working with nonprofits like museums, theaters, exhibition spaces, music venues, and schools, \u201cshopped\u201d for fodder they would use to build their future projects. <\/p><p>Today, MFTA refers to these recipients as their \u201cmember organizations,\u201d which are approved for \u201cshopping\u201d through an online application process. They must be confirmed as either a nonprofit arts or cultural group with at least two years of arts programming; individuals and projects sponsored by nonprofit organizations that also meet the two-year requirement; or New York City, State, or Federal agencies. All NYC Public Schools are pre-registered.<\/p><p>\u201cPeople came and still come to Materials for the Arts for what is often the most important element of their project: their materials,\u201d Belle explains. \u201cAnd they leave with those materials <em>and <\/em>a surplus on their budget, because they didn\u2019t have to pay a thing for them.\u201d<\/p>"

Last year alone, the organization provided free materials to 2,218 creative non-profits and public schools and diverted 1.9 million pounds of reusable goods from landfills. This year, they hope to break 2 million. <\/p><p>MFTA\u2019s massive Long Island City premises is located just down the road from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artsy.net\/moma-ps1\">MoMA PS1<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artsy.net\/sculpturecenter\">SculptureCenter<\/a>. The building houses a 25,000-square-foot hall stacked floor-to-ceiling with materials, and another 10,000 square feet devoted to offices, two classrooms, and a gallery.<\/p><p>The hall itself resembles a hybrid of the home improvement behemoth Home Depot and the traditional art supply go-to Blick. Shopping carts stacked at the entrance make way for a room so long, it appears to go on farther than the eye can see. This is where the artists, designers, teachers, and other professionals affiliated with MFTA\u2019s partner nonprofits begin their hunt. <\/p><p>During my visit to the space, Belle and I begin our tour by walking through the paper section, which is chock full of donated books, note cards, and even several shelves loaded with artwork reproductions\u2014like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artsy.net\/artist\/kasimir-severinovich-malevich\">Kazimir Malevich<\/a>\u2019s <em>Peasant Woman with Buckets and Child<\/em> (1912) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artsy.net\/artist\/morris-louis\">Morris Louis<\/a>\u2019s <em>Delta Ro<\/em> (1960)\u2014donated by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artsy.net\/pace-prints\">Pace Prints<\/a>. <\/p><p>Next, we pass through a section of old posters, printed on one side with colorful images. \u201cWe like to remind people who come to MFTA that they can also use the backs of the posters as blank paper,\u201d Belle notes. \u201cThat\u2019s what creative reuse is: taking an existing object and turning it into something new.\u201d MFTA recycles these posters for their own use, too. \u201cWhen you get a thank you note or invitation from us, say to our annual gala, you\u2019ll turn it over a see that we\u2019ve reused the paper.

In front of a section devoted to novelty items\u2014like puzzles, plastic flamingoes, and even one gold trash can printed with the United States Senate logo\u2014we see a DIY solar system model. It was made by one of the school groups that visit MFTA for field trips, from discarded Christmas decorations. Fashioned in one of MFTA\u2019s on-site classrooms, its planets were made from glass ornaments of different sizes that had been wrapped in yarn and coated with glitter. A string of twinkle lights became the stars that surrounded the celestial globes. <\/p><p>These school field trips speak to the organization\u2019s wider commitment to education, spearheaded by longtime director Harriet Taub over the past two decades. (Taub went to art school for ceramics, and also has degree in arts education.) The effort was launched in 1997, when the New York City Department of Education\u2019s Project ARTS agreed to provide a portion of funding to MFTA to allow art teachers access to the facility. <\/p><p>Taub and other members of MFTA\u2019s staff quickly recognized a disconnect, though, between the found materials they provided, and what public school teachers expected to find at the warehouse. \u201cThey kept asking, \u2018Where are the watercolors?\u2019\u201d Taub recounts. \u201cI said, \u2018You have to think outside the box! You have to figure this out!\u2019\u201d she continues with enthusiasm. A year later, in response, she and artist Joy Suarez began to offer workshops to teachers and other arts professionals on how to use nontraditional and found materials in school projects. <\/p><p>Since then, MFTA has added two classrooms to their headquarters, where they work with public school students, teachers of all stripes, and a range of other groups including people with disabilities. One class, cleverly titled \u201cPaper: From Pulp to Fiction,\u201d teaches students to make substrates, utensils, and pigments from scratch: \u201cInk from blueberries, a pen made from a bamboo shoot, a block print from a piece of discarded tile or the bottom of your sneaker,\u201d Belle explains.<\/p><p>MFTA sends trained artists into public schools around New York, too. Guided by John Cloud Kaiser, MFTA director of education, the program arranges in-school workshops that \u201cmodel creative reuse and project-based learning for students and staff,\u201d MFTA\u2019s website describes. These are attended not only by art teachers, but also by educators of other disciplines like social studies, math, and science. <\/p><p>Kaiser, who joins us for part of the tour, notes that a correlation between this program and increased test scores has been recorded in some of the public schools where it\u2019s been implemented. \u201cLast year, one of our pilot schools, P.S. 5 in Brooklyn, had the biggest increase in test scores of any school in New York City,\u201d Kaiser notes. \u201cWe\u2019ve been studying it and we\u2019ve seen the impact MFTA had on that.\u201d<\/p>"

The space is bright, bordered on one side by big windows, and filled with materials\u2014instrument cases, surfboards, painting palettes, Martin Luther King, Jr. figures, among them\u2014that Sax mined from MFTA\u2019s warehouse to create sculptures. <\/p><p>\u201cThe commercial world sees so many things as worthless\u2014so many things become trash because they become \u2018unsellable,\u2019\u201d Sax tells me. \u201cAs an artist, we look at those things and we see their value\u2014and we can redeem it through our creativity.

      "<p>What would Antoine Court de Gébelin think of the Happy Squirrel? </p><p>De Gébelin was a Protestant minister born in the 18th century. He authored the multi-volume tome <em>Le Monde primitif</em>, which insisted that the tarot deck contained secrets of the ancient Egyptians, whose priests had distilled their occult wisdom into the cards’ illustrations, imbuing them with great mystical power. Before that point, tarot was primarily a card game—meant for fun, not prophecy.</p><p>It was a bold and somewhat absurd assertion, given that de Gébelin could not read Egyptian hieroglyphics (no one could at the time, since they weren’t deciphered until the 19th century). Despite a total lack of historical evidence to back his claim, the theory stuck: Tarot decks, once a novelty, became popular tools for divination after the publication of de Gébelin’s book.</p><p>Which brings us back to the Happy Squirrel, a relatively recent addition to the tarot’s Major Arcana, and one whose provenance is less hazy: it originated on season six of <em>The Simpsons</em>. Lisa visits a fortune teller who is unconcerned when Lisa picks Death, but gasps in horror when the next card she draws is the Happy Squirrel. (When Lisa asks if the fuzzy rodent is a bad sign, the fortune teller demurs, saying that “the cards are vague and mysterious.”) Although it began as a cartoon joke, the Happy Squirrel card has made its way into over a dozen commercially available tarot decks. </p><p>So what would de Gébelin’s reaction be? The answer depends on whether tarot is a collection of timeless, mystical wisdom—or a flexible framework that has endured by changing with the times. Although tarot imagery employs supposedly universal archetypes, new decks are constantly being invented, and old decks altered. The art of tarot cards can never fully transcend its milieu. Which begs a second question: How do the cards’ art and design relate to the social changes, technological advances, and aesthetic sensibilities of their particular eras?</p>",

      '<p>Despite their aura of mystery, medieval tarot cards were not used for divination, and were probably <em>not</em> created by ancient Egyptian magicians. The earliest surviving tarot decks—now preserved in various museum collections—are Italian, and were commissioned by wealthy patrons, the same way one might have hired an artist to paint a portrait or illuminated prayerbook. </p><p>The Visconti-Sforza Tarot is a collection of decks, none complete, commissioned by the Visconti and Sforza families from the workshop of Milanese court painter Bonifacio Bembo. Cards such as Death, who rides a horse and swings a giant scythe like a player in the world’s most high-stakes polo match, will seem familiar to contemporary enthusiasts. So will the Pope, who sits on a golden throne; and the Lovers, who hold hands beneath a string of heraldic flags. Rather than looking to these cards for mystic guidance, the Visconti and Sforza families would have used them to play a trick-taking card game similar to modern-day Bridge. (Although it’s unlikely—given the good condition of the decks—that they were ever handled with much frequency).</p><p>The cards each have intricately tooled gold backgrounds that glow like the luxury items that they were. Bembo is believed to have included portraits of the families in many of the cards, as well as adding the Visconti family motto here and there for good measure. Akin to the work of <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/fra-angelico">Fra Angelico</a> and other early-Renaissance artists, the cards are opulent but pictorially flat, although the bodies appear in naturalistic perspective and their clothing billows around them, suggesting volume and form. </p><p><br></p><h2>The 18th-Century Conver Classic</h2>',

      '<p>Produced in 1760, French engraver Nicolas Conver’s deck of delicate woodcuts, the Tarot de Marseille, is the template on which many contemporary decks are based. Like the Visconti-Sforza Tarot, the deck’s design likely originated in 15th-century Italy before traveling north to France. It’s a favorite of many tarot enthusiasts, most notably the cult film director Alejandro Jodorowsky, who <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/fashion/alejandro-jodorowsky-and-his-tarot-de-marseille.html?mcubz=1">designed his own deck</a> based on the style. While the Conver deck wasn’t the first to be called the Tarot de Marseille, it’s highly prized by collectors for its delicate color palette of sky blues and minty greens. The graphic black outlines and blunt shading of the prints give the cards a simple and rough-hewn appearance, which adds to the ambience of ancient wisdom. The popularity of the tarot grew due to advances in printing technology and via the writings of 19th-century French occultists such as Éliphas Lévi and Etteilla, which popularized the use of tarot as a method of fortune-telling and assigned additional divinatory meaning to the cards.</p><p><br></p><h2>The New Mystics</h2>',

      '<p>The Rider-Waite Smith deck, which debuted in 1909, remains the most recognizable and popular today. Designed by artist Pamela Colman Smith under the direction of the mystic A.E. Waite, it was the first to be mass-produced in English, and was intended for divination rather than gameplay. Smith and Waite were both active members of the Order of the Golden Dawn, a secretive organization devoted to the exploration of the paranormal and occult (allegedly Bram Stoker, Aleister Crowley, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle were also members). </p><p>In addition to Smith’s occult bonafides, she was also an accomplished artist, championed by <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/alfred-stieglitz">Alfred Stieglitz</a>, who collected her work and showed it at his gallery. Smith created fully-realized illustrations of all 78 cards that made the deck a treasure-trove for cartomancers, who now had a much richer store of images to work with. (Previously, only the 22 Major Arcana cards such as the Fool, the Magician, and the Lovers had been elaborately illustrated—traditionally, the Minor Arcana cards, which are roughly analogous to the suits in a deck of modern playing cards, were not.) The Major Arcana were based on the Tarot de Marseille drawings, but rendered in an illustrative <a href="https://www.artsy.net/gene/art-nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> style rich with patterns. Even the Fool looks debonaire; he carelessly approaches the cliff, a feather in his cap and a blooming rose in his elegant fingers, wearing a floral tunic that looks straight out of <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/william-morris">William Morris</a>’s workshop.</p><p><br></p><h2>An Occultist’s Pure Geometry</h2>',

      '<p>The Thoth deck, named for the Ibis-faced Egyptian god more commonly known as Horus, was painted by the artist Frieda Harris based on direction from the infamous occultist-about-town Aleister Crowley. Completed in the early 1940s, but not widely available until 1969, it features <a href="https://www.artsy.net/gene/art-deco">Art Deco</a> borders resembling the pattern of a butterfly wing. </p><p>The deck is an aesthetic departure from the Rider-Waite’s homey <a href="https://www.artsy.net/gene/arts-and-crafts-movement">Arts and Crafts</a> aesthetic. Shaped by Harris’s interest in pure geometry, the cards are reminiscent of the work of Swedish painter <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/hilma-af-klint">Hilma af Klint</a> (a visionary artist who shared Harris’s interest in spiritualism and the writings of Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner, both popular subjects of study among the middle and upper classes in the early 20th century). Harris’s shaded orbs and compass-inscribed curves that fill the background of each card bear more than a passing resemblance to Klint’s highly-saturated geometries. Klint, considered by some to be Europe’s first abstract painter, believed that her luminous compositions were the created under the influence of spirits. (The same could easily be said of Harris because she was taking direction from Crowley, who was believed to be a medium, able to channel ancient and magical forces.) </p><p>It’s no coincidence that Klint’s paintings and Harris’s Thoth illustrations were shown in the same pavilion at the 2013 Venice Biennale, which was intended to amplify voices that had previously been excluded and “cover 100 years of dreams and visions,” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/arts/design/massimiliano-gioni-of-venice-biennale.html">according</a> to curator Massimiliano Gioni.</p><p><br></p><h2>Sex &amp; Self-Help, ’70s Style</h2>',

The cards’ colors are lush and the lines are fluid. Greer chose to crop his figures tightly and removed the borders, allowing the illustrations to extend to the edges. The effect is fresh and personal. Formally, the Morgan-Greer illustrations have more in common with Jefferson Starship’s <em>Spitfire</em> (1976) album cover than with contemporary painting of the same period—the pendulum had swung away from figuration and would take a few years longer to swing back—but it’s possible to find a resonance between this deck’s art and a work like <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/judy-chicago">Judy </a><a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/judy-chicago">Chicago</a>’s <em>Dinner Party </em>(1979), with its powerful goddess and blooming flowers.

      "<p>The Black Power Tarot was conceived by musician King Khan in consultation with Alejandro Jodorowsky, and designed by illustrator Michael Eaton in 2015. The deck celebrates the strength and achievements of Black musicians, artists, and activists while staying faithful to the imagery and composition of the classic Tarot de Marseilles. The familiar faces of Malcolm X, James Brown, Tina Turner, Howlin’ Wolf, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, and others emerge from the Major Arcana. Sun Ra is there too, appropriately imagined as the Sun card. At a time when Black Americans are at a high risk of being the victims of state-sponsored violence, the Black Power Tarot feels especially urgent. By situating these figures within a centuries-old framework of esoteric wisdom, Khan affirms their value and influence, the importance of their legacy. By placing them on cards used for fortune-telling, he extends their power into the future. <span class='content-end'></span></p><p> &nbsp;—Ariela Gittlen</p>",

      "<p><span class='content-start'>A</span>round two years ago, a collector encouraged New York-based ceramic artist <a href='https://www.artsy.net/artist/jennie-jieun-lee'>Jennie Jieun Lee</a> to apply for an art prize. “I was a little bit scared. I’d applied to a few things in the past and been rejected, so I was bummed by that,” she admits. “I entered not thinking that I was going to win, but that it would be a good exercise to go through the process.” &nbsp;</p><p>It paid off. She was among several artists in 2015 who won an Artadia Award—an unrestricted, merit-based prize of up to $10,000, which is given to visual artists working in certain U.S. cities. The winnings, as well as the experience, helped Lee push her career forward. </p><p>“That money enabled me to move into a bigger studio and buy a larger kiln,” she explains. “With that movement, I was able to make my career.” And the momentum continued: More recently, she won a Pollock-Krasner grant that she used to move cross-country and fund a residency in the ceramic department at California State University, Long Beach. </p><p>Lee is by no means alone. While we’ve all heard of the boldfaced awards, like the Turner Prize or the Hugo Boss Prize, which tend to anoint artists when they’re already well known to the art world, a wealth of awards are available for lesser-known and emerging artists. </p>",

      "<p>While applying for these opportunities can be daunting and time-consuming, it’s rewarding in more ways than one (even if you don’t end up winning). Artist prizes can be a path to prestige and profits, as well as a way to land exhibitions, make influential contacts, and gain valuable feedback about your work.</p><p>Based on conversations with artists who have won several different prizes, we share guidance below on how to go about applying for these opportunities, navigating the process, and benefiting from the positive outcomes they can offer.</p><p><br></p><h2>Finding the Prize That’s Right for You</h2><p>Artists should seek out opportunities based on their eligibility and the kind of work they make. “Don’t change to accommodate prizes,” advises London artist <a href='https://www.artsy.net/artist/ally-mcintyre'>Allyson McIntyre</a>, who won the 2015 HIX Award, which gives artists £10,000 to go towards a solo show at the London gallery HIX ART. “Be authentic to your practice and find the prizes that work for what you do.”</p><p>It’s important to recognize the distinction between prizes and awards—which are generally given in recognition of past work—and grants, which typically serve to facilitate future projects. Many artists note that they apply to both types of opportunities based on recommendations by word-of-mouth; they find that peers, former teachers, or other art-world contacts can share valuable input. New Orleans-based artist <a href='https://www.artsy.net/artist/aron-belka'>Aron Belka</a>, who won the BOMBAY SAPPHIRE® Artisan Series in 2015, advises artists to search for opportunities locally, through art schools, regional arts councils, art centers, and museums. &nbsp;</p><p>For those who perhaps do not have a tight-knit network of artist peers, there are several open-call websites and listservs that aggregate information on prizes, grants, and juried exhibitions. These include <a href='https://www.submittable.com/'>Submittable</a> and <a href='https://www.callforentry.org/'>Call for Entry</a>. On the latter, artists can create a profile, upload artwork images, and browse opportunities.</p>",

      '<p><br></p><h2>The Application Process</h2><p>Most awards will require several images of your work, as well as a written artist statement to provide some context. With higher-stakes prizes, artists may be asked to submit recommendation letters from peers or professionals. </p><p>A somewhat obvious, though easily botched, element of the application process is following directions. “You have to be careful not to get lazy with how you submit, as it may lead to you being disqualified, which is just a waste of your time,” McIntyre explains. Be sure to read the fine print and adhere to all particulars regarding preparing, labeling, and submitting application materials.</p><p>Organizations administering prizes will allow artists to submit several—typically three to eight—images. They are generally interested in seeing recent work, created over the past two or three years. Some prizes may specify that artists create a new, original work to submit. Artists should be sure to send high-quality photographs; if resources allow, hire a photographer (or recruit a qualified friend) to have works shot professionally.</p><p>For those artists who work across mediums—perhaps printmaking one day, performance the next—know that it might not be advisable to try to include the full breadth of your practice in a single application. “Try to hone in on a single idea, or a couple of ideas,” says artist <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/alex-podesta">Alex Podesta</a>, who won the BOMBAY SAPPHIRE® Artisan Series in 2013, and has also served as a juror for other awards. “I’ve been on the other side of this a number of times, and when you’re reviewing applications it’s confusing and not helpful to have an artist submitting sculpture, painting, <em>and</em> a video piece. Focus on one aspect of your work.” </p><p>In addition to images, a written artist’s statement that explains and contextualizes the artist’s work is important, too. Artists should get in the habit of updating their statements regularly, adapting their texts to accurately reflect their current practices. Artist <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/yevgeniya-baras">Yevgeniya Baras</a>, who won an Artadia Award in New York in 2015, notes that she rewrites or edits her artist statement every two years. &nbsp;</p><p>For certain awards, artists may need to be able to speak about their work with jurors in person. If this is the case, be prepared to take full advantage of the opportunity. Baras notes that for Artadia, the panel of jurors visited her studio; she was careful to delve deeper into elements of her work that don’t come across through two-dimensional images or her online application. For the Meurice Prize for contemporary art, artists must give an oral presentation of their work. “While we don’t judge the artist on their ability to conduct a perfect verbal presentation of the work, we are of course interested to hear the artist speak of their work in a very intimate way, and that can actually be the decisive sector,” says Jennifer Flay, director of the art fair FIAC, and a juror for the Meurice Prize.</p><p><br></p><h2>Application Fees</h2><p>While it’s free to apply for some awards, it’s not uncommon to pay a fee in the range of $20 to $75—which can make a difference for artists looking to apply to multiple opportunites. Belka notes that if the stakes are high, an application fee may be worth it, but he advises that artists do their research before submitting said fees to avoid scams. </p><p>McIntyre recalls that she once applied to a competition that promised winners a show in Venice. “I was accepted, but they asked for an outrageous artist fee of €500,” she says. Later she learned that fellow artists had fallen for the scam and lost their money—and the works they had submitted. “Have discretion and awareness that your money may amount to nothing,” she counsels.</p><p><br></p><h2>Set Expectations and Be Persistent</h2><p>No one wins every award; there’s often a trail of rejections on the way to any prize. Baras, who landed the Rema Hort Mann Foundation Emerging Artist Grant in 2014 and the Artadia Award thereafter, notes that there’s been plenty of failure mixed in with those successes. (She estimates that she submits around 10 award or grant applications per year.) </p><p>“Assume that for nine out of every 10 applications that you send in, it’s not going to be the work they’re looking for,” Podesta says. “Younger artists, especially, shouldn’t get daunted. Remember that the work just isn’t resonating with the [specific] people reviewing it.”</p><p>It helps to go into the application process with an open mind, and reasonable hopes. “I went into it not expecting it to make my career, but rather for it to be an addition to it,” says <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/kristine-mays">Kristine Mays</a>, who won the BOMBAY SAPPHIRE® Artisan Series in 2014. Artists, she adds, should simply stay true to their craft, and keep working away.</p><p>Remember that rejection, while disappointing, can be a learning experience. “Without this kind of risk, you can’t really put yourself out there,” Baras says. “Most applications, for many amazing awards, just take a few days. It’s a way to see a new community, to seek new eyes, and I think that’s a necessary and healthy risk for an artist to take.”</p><p>Lee advises fellow artists to cast a wide net and apply to as many opportunities as possible, developing a thick skin as they do. “If you get rejected one year, apply again the next,” she says, simply. “It’s about being persistent and not taking anything personally.”</p><p><br></p>',

      "<p><br></p><h2>Make the Most of Winning</h2><p>Depending on the prize, artists may be awarded a stipend to create new work for a show or unrestricted funds to further their careers. In both cases, artists report that these funds have gone towards keeping their art practices up and running, be it through realizing new works and shows or for subsidizing rent, bills, and the costs of production and supplies. &nbsp;</p><p>For example, the Meurice Prize, which supports artists under the age of 45 who show with French galleries, awards €20,000, which is split between the artist and their gallery. This year, the BOMBAY SAPPHIRE® Artisan Series (which is only open to entrants from North America) awards a grand prize winner a stipend of $10,000 to create a public artwork. </p><p>In some cases, like Lee’s, a sizable prize could help an artist move into a bigger studio, relocate to another city, or participate in a residency. “Before, I never even thought about moving out of New York,” she says. “The Pollock-Krasner grant gave me the freedom to possibly move cross-country to explore this residency. I feel like it’s completely changed my life, and now I’m not sure when I’m coming back.”</p><p><br></p><h2>It’s More Than Just Money </h2><p>Baras notes that even if she hadn’t won the Artadia Award it would’ve been a rewarding experience due to the panel of jurors she encountered. “Whether you win or not, whoever’s on the panel remembers your work,” she says. “It’s beneficial regardless to put yourself out there because you really never know who might notice.” &nbsp; </p><p>Other prizes similarly award artists with the opportunity to exhibit their work to a new audience. The Daiwa Foundation Art Prize, awarded each year to a British artist, serves to give that artist a solo gallery exhibition in Japan. And the Luxembourg Art Prize gives finalists the opportunity to show their work in a group exhibition in Luxembourg; the winner is awarded €25,000 to produce new work for a solo presentation at Galerie Hervé Lancelin for an exhibition the following year. </p><p>For Belka and Mays, who both won the chance to show their work at the Scope Art Fair in New York through the BOMBAY SAPPHIRE® Artisan Series, winning led to important exposure and networking opportunities. “Overall, the most positive outcome was being able to put myself in arenas I’d never been in before,” Mays says of her experience. She saw it as a “jump start” for her career; she’s been busy making and showing her work steadily since her Scope debut.</p><p>“I made a point of greeting and speaking to everyone that came to the space,” Mays adds. Both artists recommend being prepared with business cards and following up with the contacts you make via email. Belka notes that he made an important collector contact that he maintains today. “Come prepared to talk about your work, have cards, spread your name, and get yourself out there,” says Belka.</p><p>Mays was also inspired by the feedback she received from viewers of her work. “Many times we overlook the value of feedback from people, the ideas that can come out of conversation with people,” she says. </p><p><br></p><h2>Building Confidence </h2><p>Most artists agree that one of the most impactful parts of winning a prize is the vote of confidence that it provides. Formal recognition can be a sign of assurance that they were right to pursue a career as an artist, and can inspire them to get back in the studio. &nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a nice confirmation to know that you can communicate to people you don’t even know, and just continue along the path of making your work,” Baras muses. “I see it as a kind of hug. Generally, you’re sort of hugging yourself as an artist—but once in awhile, you get an acknowledgment from the outside world.”<span class='content-end'></span></p>",

      "<p>While applying for these opportunities can be daunting and time-consuming, it’s rewarding in more ways than one (even if you don’t end up winning).

Many artists note that they apply to both types of opportunities based on recommendations by word-of-mouth; they find that peers, former teachers, or other art-world contacts can share valuable input. New Orleans-based artist <a href='https://www.artsy.net/artist/aron-belka'>Aron Belka</a>, who won the BOMBAY SAPPHIRE® Artisan Series in 2015, advises artists to search for opportunities locally, through art schools, regional arts councils, art centers, and museums. &nbsp;</p><p>For those who perhaps do not have a tight-knit network of artist peers, there are several open-call websites and listservs that aggregate information on prizes, grants, and juried exhibitions. These include <a href='https://www.submittable.com/'>Submittable</a> and <a href='https://www.callforentry.org/'>Call for Entry</a>. On the latter, artists can create a profile, upload artwork images, and browse opportunities.</p>",
